Now to create a cell ... (NOTE will need to have imported the padstacks from the
ODA central library)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For this tutorial we will use a
datasheet from a small chip
so this tutorial will have a more realistic feel.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Use the following link to obtain the
chip datasheet from which we will create a cell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Taking a look at the datasheet for
the MAX 3314 we can see
that we will be creating an 8-pin SOIC, so in the total number of pins

put 8 and in the Package group use the drop-down menu and find SOIC.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>





<p class="MsoNormal">Make sure to name your cell and to
specify the number of
layers to be 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason we need two layers is because there is a top and there will be a bottom.
You will not need to use the bottom layer for
this tutorial, but you must still specify that layer anyway. Now
click the "Cell Properties" button on the lower left hand corner to open
the following image:</p>

<br>


The only thing that you need to check on this screen is that the Units:
field is changed to "mm". We choose to use "mm" because the
padstacks we will be using have been created in mm units.
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Click the "close" button on the cell properties
window, then press the "ok" button on the create new package window
and now two new windows will appear, the
window with the focus will be the "Place Pins" window:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the left side of the window are
your unidentified pins and on the right side of the window are two tabs.
The "Parameter Place" tab will place your pins according to rows
and columns you specify. <b>IGNORE THIS TAB!</b>
The next tab --- "Pattern Place" ---
is the tab you should be looking at.
Click on that tab and then click on the drop-down menu to find the SOIC
option as in the following picture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The reason to use the pattern place
option is that the pins will be placed according to the
standard pin numbering for that package. <b>Pin numbering is
extremely important</b> .... it must perfectly match the package
or your connections won't go to the pins that you think!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Your window should look like this now:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are four parameters you will need
to specify to this tool in order for it to create the cell.
Remember that if your cell is not created with precision
your chip will not fit your board. Once your board has been
fabricated, component fitting problems are not so easy to fix.
Often they result in ugly wiring patches. So, be careful here.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The last page of the MAX3314
datasheet has the dimensions of the actual chip package.
Use this page to fill in the 4 blank fields.
<b>!!!NOTE!!!!: this cell creation wizard uses milimeters
for its measurements.</b>
You must make sure to input the correct value
from the datasheet. Most datasheets will either be in
millimeters or in inches.  Always make sure you check this.
Lucky for you, the datasheet I provided for this exercise
has both values. However you may find that datasheets
for your parts do not specify which units they are using.
DO NOT ASSUME!!! If you cannot find out what units the datasheet
uses, call the company and have them tell you. Or, choose an
equivalent part from another vendor that documents their packages
a bit more carefully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should find that you will be
using the fields (from the datasheet I provided)
"E", "H", "e", and "D".
Please note that these particular symbols are not standard
across the industry.  Always check your vendor's datasheet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The added difficulty on this particular
datasheet is that there are minimum values and maximum values.
So which do you use?!?
Well, I am about to provide you with several formulas that are
designed to work across the whole ranges, providing all the
information you need. I will provide five formulas, but only four
formulas are below. I will introduce the last formula in just a
second and they are as follows:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" width="70%">
 <tr>
  <td height="19"> Center pad to center pad: </td>
  <td height="19"> E(min) + 2 L(max)</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td height="19"> Pitch (distance between adjacent pins) : </td>
  <td height="19"> e </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td height="19"> Length of Cell: </td>
  <td height="19"> D(max) </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td height="19"> Width of Cell: </td>
  <td height="19"> E(min) - 0.2mm <br>
( 0.2mm is subtracted because we do not want the silkscreen outline to overlap any of the pads.)
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">!!!NOTE!!!: Though these formulas should be used
for all SOIC cells you will be making, the symbols representing each
of the dimensions may not remain the same. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following image shows approximately the
results you should have for the example MAX3314 cell we are building.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 751px; height: 390px;" alt="" src="Pictures/8-SOIC_pattern_values.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(8-SOIC pattern values)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now to deal with the left side of the
cell creation wizard</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following link to an image has been taken
from OPTIMUM DxExp
Library: Land Pattern Specification Sheet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="Pictures/9-land_patter_specification.JPG">Use this link to view/download the image</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This sheet will help you understand
the naming scheme for the padstacks located in the ODA library.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In this case we will be looking for a
padstack starting with &ldquo;SR&rdquo; ("S" for surface-mount technology and "R" for
rectangular shape) and then followed by the dimensions of the
rectangle. In this case the last formula to remember is that the
rectangular land pattern shape for a SOIC should be 2x the max length of the pad on
the package, and 1x the max width of the pad.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should have gotten the dimensions
of 2.54 mm and 0.49 mm. The closest padstack to that
size is the 255x50 (Note the assumed position of the invisible decimal points).
It is always better to have a pad that is slightly larger than the pin
so always make sure to choose the larger pad if you must choose between two.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Use the drop down menus for each of
the pins and select the "SR255X050" padstack.
This is the surface-mount rectangular pad with
dimensions 2.55mm by 0.50mm. Because all of the pins
will use the same pad, you may select multiple fields together by
holding shift, selecting all of the fields and then,
<b>while still holding shift,</b>
select the padstack through the drop-down menu.
Your pin placement window should look like the following
when you are ready to move on.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now click the "Place" button and let
the wizard create your Cell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>Oops! We've created a DRC error! This happened
because of the <b>orientation</b> of the padstacks. The chosen padstack has
its width (2.54 mm) and its height (0.50 mm) whereas we want something that
is taller than it is wide ... i.e. a rotated version with the width and height reversed.
To fix this, highlight all of the padstacks and change
their rotation to 90 degrees as shown in the following picture:</o:p></p>
<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>(10_1-place_pins_rotate.jpg)</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now, click the "Place" buttton and the following
should be the result of your pin placement</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 630px; height: 661px;" alt="" src="Pictures/11-Cell_layout.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(11- Cell layout)</p>

window again, click the button that looks like
the following:</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>(11_1- Place_Pins_button.jpg)</o:p></p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now we will need to modify the
REF-DES fields and Part Number fields to be more presentable.
This can be done by going into "draw" mode.
To get into "draw" mode click the button
located on the toolbar at the top of the screen that looks like the
following image.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 28px; height: 25px;" alt="" src="Pictures/12-draw_mode_button.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(12-draw-mode button)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once in this mode you should be able to
select and move the REF-DES fields and Part Number Fields.
My recommendation is to have the REF-DES fields on the sides
of the footprint and then to place the
Part Number Fields either on the sides of the footprint as well, or 
place them within the footprint. The reasoning
is that when the board has been fabricated and assembled, the chip will
sit on top of the footprint you have just designed.
You will need to know which chips are which.  The reference designator
will be your key because it appears on the silkscreen.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now back to business. When you double
click the REF-DES or Part Number fields you will notice that
the properties window appears. If it does not, click the
following button to enable the properties window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(13- properties button)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Use this "Properties" window to see and make changes in
the various properties of the selected object. Note that there
are two REF-DES fields, each containing the cell's reference designator
but each presenting it on a different layer and in a different location.
One is the "Silkscreen reference designator" and the other is
the "Assembly reference designator".  You can tell
which is which by selecting one of them and noting the Type field.
You can make changes within this window.  For example, you can make
the text a different size or even have it drawn in a different font.
It is <b><i>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</i></b> that you do all of your
REF-DES and Part Number fields in Gerber-compatible fonts
in order that your fields will correctly appear on the
fabricated board!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By using the following button, you
will be able to change
the visibility of objects in your cell.

field, so click the button that looks like this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 241px; height: 458px;" alt="" src="Pictures/15-Display_Control_window.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(15-Display control window)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In order to see the part number field
you will need to scroll down to the section for Assembly Items.
The check boxes on the left indicate which fields are displayed, and the
boxes unchecked indicate fields not displayed.
Play around with this display control window if you wish
to customize what fields are displayed.</p>
<p>I recommend that you create all your parts in the same fashion. That way
all of them will be right, or wrong, in the same way. In addition
to moving around the Ref_des and part number fields, you will also need
to add a pin #1 indicator. This is absolutely necessary to ensure
that the assembler doesn't solder your chip on backwards. For
surface mount chips, a small circle, or dot, close to pin #1 is the
usual indicator. For through-hole parts, a square pin one is the
usual indicator, though using a small circle or dot nearby works as well.<br>
<br>
After moving around the Ref_des and Part Number fields and adding
the pin #1 indicator, your part should
look like the following:<br>
<br>

<img style="width: 634px; height: 713px;" alt="" src="Pictures/16-recommended_layout.jpg"><br>
<br>

(16-recommended_layout.jpg)<br>
<br>

I oriented the various parts of the new cell (as seen in the previous image)
for the following reasons:<br>

<ul>
<li> The white Ref Des field will be printed on the Silkscreen layer and
will be used by you to identify the chip is after your board
has been assembled. You will want the white Ref Des field to be clearly
displayed and never covered by other Cells or pads.</li>
<br>
<li> The orange Ref Des field will be printed only in the Gerber files
specifically for the Assembler (on the so-called "Assembly Plot").
By placing this field in the center of your cell you are guaranteeing
that the assembler will not have any issues knowing which part
to place at that location on the
board.</li>
<br>
<li> The purple "Part No" field will be included only in the Gerber files for
the Assembly Plot as well as displayed while editing in Expedition PCB (if you
have their visibility enabled in that program). This field will likely also be
included in the files sent to the assembler as another
way to make sure the correct part is placed at that location on the board.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
You should make all of the fields a height of 1.27mm (which is ~50 mils)
and each will use a pen width of at least 0.15mm
(6 mils).  If you draw with a pen that is much smaller than this it 
is likely that the paint will break up. If this happens, your
silkscreen text items may not be readable.
