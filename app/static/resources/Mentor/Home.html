<h1>CAD Tutorials -- Home Page</h1>
<p>This site provides tutorials for the Mentor Graphics
Expedition Enterprise Flow 2007.2.  Access to this software has been
generously provided by Mentor Graphics for use in the UCSB Computer
Engineering Capstone Design Project Course.
<p>There are three principal components that we'll need to use:
<ul>
<li>The Library Manager</li>
<li>The front-end schematic tool -- DxDesigner</li>
<li>The back-end board layout tool -- ExpeditionPCB</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorials should be taken in top-to-bottom order as listed in the
Links pane at the left, starting with the "PCB Basics" section and 
then moving on to the "Glossary", found within the "Library Manager" tutorials,
where often-used terms and terminology are explained.  
<br>
<p>Before moving on to the tutorials, you may want to view this short video
to see whether or not you may have
