<p class="MsoNormal">In this tutorial we will learn how to
link a Symbol (used in DxDesigner) to a Cell (used in Expedition PCB).
&nbsp;In order to do this tutorial properly you will need to have
already created a Symbol and a Cell. &nbsp;If you have not
created them yet, please refer to the <a href="../Symbol/Symbol.html">Symbol</a> and <a href="../Cell/Create_Cell.html">Cell</a> tutorials</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now let's learn how to connect a symbol with a cell
so that you can get on to creating your Schematic!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(1-opening part editor)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Just as the above image hints at, go
to the tools menu -&gt; Part Editor&hellip; in order to start creating a Part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 566px; height: 590px;" alt="" src="Pictures/2-Part_Editor.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(2- part editor)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you have already looked at the
cell tutorial then you will be slightly familiar with this interface.
The active partition is named in the top drop-down box and all of the
parts contained in that partition are listed below.
The Parts listing box has a "properties" button, a "new part" button,
a "copy" button, an "undo" button, and a "delete" button,
in that order, from left to right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the "new part" button, a
new row is added to the parts listing box with the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; in one or
more columns. Replace those words with the name of the part.
Make sure to fill all three columns with exactly the same name as
it will make it easier to reference the part later on.
When you have your new part fully named and highlighted like the
in the next image, click the button on
the bottom right labeled <b style="">Pin Mapping&hellip;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 566px; height: 590px;" alt="" src="Pictures/3-new_part.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(3- new part)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The next image shows you the pin mapping window</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 746px; height: 602px;" alt="" src="Pictures/4-Pin_Mapping_window.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(4- Pin Mapping window)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are three main aspects to the pin mapping window.
In the upper right hand corner is the "Assign Symbol" section,
in the upper left hand corner is the "Assign Cell" section, and
on the bottom of the pin mapping window is where the actual mapping
occurs. In order to start linking the cell and symbol you will need
to place each in their respective sections.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To do this, you must know about the four
buttons within both the "Assign symbol" and "Assign cell" sections.
From left to right, the buttons are "new", "open", "undo", and "delete".
You will not need to use the "new" button as this will add complications
to your already complicated design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Let's begin ...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you need to create a new symbol or cell for your part, go to
the library manager and open up the symbol editor or cell editor, as
well as refer to the <a href="../Symbol/Symbol.html"><u>SYMBOL
CREATION TUTORIAL</u></a> or <a href="../Cell/Create_Cell.html"><u>CELL
CREATION TUTORIAL</u></a>.
If you already have a symbol and cell created,
then click on the button second from the left from either top section
that looks like the following.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 24px; height: 21px;" alt="" src="Pictures/5-open_button.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(5-open button)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This will open the following window which will allow you
to add both a symbol and a cell to your part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 297px; height: 595px;" alt="" src="Pictures/6-import_window.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(6-import window)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If your window does not correspond to
the previous image, it is because you are on the Cells tab of
the import window. Merely click on either tab to switch between
Cells and Symbols. Right now, click on the Symbols tab.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The top half of the window is pretty
self explanatory. There is a drop-down box for selecting either
all partitions or a specific partition which will then populate the box
below it with the symbols currently in that partition.
What does need attention is the lower half.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The lower half of this window is used only when you have created
a symbol that will be implemented several times on the cell.
This is best described through an example.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Let us suppose, for example, that you want to use one
AND gate in your design. You might find that the only parts that are available
have four AND gates per chip (i.e. so-called "quad AND gates"),
and thus you will have bought a chip with four times as many gates
as you need for your design.  In addition you might have already created
the symbol for your single AND gate, but now you have a chip with four of them.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This problem is solved by inserting
the number &ldquo;4&rdquo; in the field &ldquo;Number of slots in component&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Enough with this side-comment.  We are actually not going to
fully explain about how to deal with more than one "slot" per component since
this is a fairly complex task and we do not need it for class projects.
You will, for the most part, be designing a symbol
specifically for each cell.  Thus you may just insert the value
&ldquo;1&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Number of
slots in component&rdquo; box like the following image shows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 253px; height: 109px;" alt="" src="Pictures/7-multiple_instances_check_box.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(7-multiple instances check box)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now you are done with the Symbol tab
so let's move on to the cell tab. You will find that the cell
tab is very simple. Here is what the window
looks like.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 297px; height: 595px;" alt="" src="Pictures/8-cells_import.JPG" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(8-cells import)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Merely use the three drop-down boxes
to narrow the search for cells to display in the lower box
and then click on the cell you wish to
use in this part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you are done click the "OK" button
and have the symbol and cell added to the part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now to connect the names of the pins
from the symbol to the actual pins on the cell,
including those pins that are not connected and also those that are
attached to power or ground.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the bottom of the Pin Mapping
screen we find the pin mapping section. There are
three tabs to this section and you will need to deal only with two of them.
The logical tab can be ignored.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The second tab is the physical tab
which will connect the
labeled pins in the symbol to the pins available in the cell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The third and final tab is the Supply
and NC tab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
tab is used for the pins that are not
connected to anything and for pins that are to be connected to either
the power
or ground that were not specified in the symbol. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To specify a supply name, left click
on the Supply name
field and type a name followed by pressing the
&ldquo;enter&rdquo; key.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
may then enter as many pins that are
connected to that supply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To specify no connect pins simply
follow the last few steps
listed for adding supply pins on the bottom section with the label
&ldquo;no
connect&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
