<p class="MsoNormal">This tutorial is to introduce the
different methods of
routing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
two different
methods: 1. Interactive 2. Auto Route</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For those of you who would like to
follow along with my
examples, <a href="../FAE/Route.zip">download this zip file</a>.<span style=""> &nbsp;</span><span style=""></span>The
following image shows
how all of the chips are placed:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(1-start.jpg)<br>
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>All of the thin white lines that you see show
connections between chips that will need to be made. &nbsp;If a surface
mount component has a thin white X on a pad, that means that the pad
must connect to another plane through the use of a thermal.</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Auto Route feature of Expedition
PCB is very
powerful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
example I have above is
quite simple, however, the Auto Router will be able to figure out how
to
connect very complex designs so that you will not have to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To open up the Auto Route
window, click the
menu <u>R</u>oute -&gt; Auto Route.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The following image is the Auto Route
window:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(2-auto_route_window.jpg)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When you first run the auto route all
passes will be
enabled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each pass
is designed to do one
task to your entire board before performing another specific task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, leave all of
the passes enabled so
that you will be able to see what the auto router can do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Click the Route button on
the bottom right
and watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your
board should look
something close to the following after running the Auto Router:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 639px; height: 639px;" alt="" src="Pictures/3-auto_routed.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(3-auto_routed.jpg)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see the auto router will
not always produce
perfect routing.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several
wires can be shortened from what was drawn and there are 2 thermals
with connections purelly underneath the chip. &nbsp;Having no access to
a wire is very bad because if that connection needs to be severed
because of a mistake in connecting the chip, you will need to remove
the chip before you can change the wiring. &nbsp;If you have access to
every single wire at some point, you will not need to remove any chips
in order to change the wiring of your board.</p>
<br>
Though the connection is correct, the wire between U100 and C1 uses a
via to connect to the bottom layer. &nbsp;That via is not needed and
all we will need to do is move the routing around to remove that layer
change. &nbsp;First delete the routing between C1 and U100 and then we
can move the connection between U100 and CR1 above C1. &nbsp;To move
routes, simply left-mouse click on the routing and then drag to the new
location you wish it to be. &nbsp;If you are following along, try and
get your board to look like the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/4-moved_routing.jpg" alt=""><br>
(4-moved_routing.jpg)<br>
<br>
The ability to move already routed connections is the most powerful
aspect of the routing tools. &nbsp;In addition to moving them, you can
draw in your own routes, like we will in a second, and the routing
tools will attempt to maintain previous connections while accomodating
you while you draw in your route.<br>
<br>
Click the menu <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>oute
-&gt; Interactive -&gt; Plow and your cursor will turn into a pair of
crosshairs. &nbsp;While your cursor looks like crosshairs, you will be
able to manually route the connections indicated by the thin white
lines mentioned earlier. &nbsp;Left-mouse click and drag from the
through hole on C1 to pin 11 of U100 and watch how the routing moves
around your cursor. &nbsp;When you reach pin 11, the route will
automatically complete itself and it should look something like the
following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/5-new_route.jpg" alt=""><br>
(5-new_route.jpg)<br>
<br>
Now the issue of routing completely under a chip needs to be addressed.
&nbsp;Pin 15 of U100 and pin 16 of U101 both are routed 100% under the
chip. &nbsp;To change that, simply left-mouse click on the thermal and
drag it to the outside of the chip like in the following image:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/6-moved_thermal.jpg" alt=""><br>
(6-moved_thermal.jpg)<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the routing for U101 and J2:<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/7-need_improvement.jpg" alt=""><br>
(7-need_improvement.jpg)<br>
<br>
As you can see, the routing between the connector J2 and the chip U101
is mediocre at best. &nbsp;Sometimes you can make the routing better by
simply rotating one of the chips/connectors so that the routes overlap
less. &nbsp;Lets try rotating the connector J2 180 degrees. &nbsp;In
order to do that you will need to get back into place mode, then you
will be able to select the connector and rotate it. &nbsp;Watch as the
routes maintain connectivity, though not optimally.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/8-rotation.jpg" alt=""><br>
(8-rotation.jpg)<br>
<br>
The previous image shows even worse connections, however that was just
because the routing tools tried to maintain the connections previously
made. &nbsp;Try deleting all of the connections like in the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Pictures/9-reroute.jpg" alt=""><br>
(9-reroute.jpg)<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now open up the auto routing window again and click only the last routing option like in the following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 794px; height: 363px;" src="Pictures/10-reroute_options.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(10-reroute_options.jpg)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>The reason for only enabling the last route
pass is so that all of your other connections will be maintained.
&nbsp;Using the other routing options will change another other manual
routing you have performed. &nbsp;Click the route button and look at
the new connections:</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="Pictures/11-rerouted.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>(11-rerouted.jpg)&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see the new routes are actually worse
than before we started moving the connector's orientation, but do not
be fooled into thinking that the first orientation of J2 was the better
orientation. &nbsp;By deleting the 4 routes again and by manually
routing, you can obtain the following:</p>
<img src="Pictures/12-rerouted_optimally.jpg" alt=""><br>
<p class="MsoNormal">(12-rerouted_optimally.jpg)<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>Everyone can agree that the above routing is better than the other ways that the connector has been routed to the chip U101.</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As fair warning you should always doublecheck the
routing of your chips after running the auto router because some times
you can draw better connections by hand.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Routing Advice</span></b><span style="font-size: 18pt;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Run the auto router first.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Often
the auto router will not get
the most optimum connections but at least it will give you an idea of
how
things can be connected</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Always double check the auto router.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Some
people may find that the auto
routing will look good enough for them, however I will warn those
people right
now that you should always double check the auto router because you
should try
and make your wires as short as possible, which is not something the
auto
router is always good at.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Always have access to wire. (I.E. a
connection is not
completely underneath a chip)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The
auto router will make some
connections this way and that is very bad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If you accidently wire two things together that were not
supposed to be
wired together, you will need to be able to cut the wire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the connection is
entirely under chips you
will need to remove the chip before you can cut the wire, which will
more than
likely damage the chip in the removal process.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Try to use 45 degree corners, not 90
degree corners</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">If
you imagine the routes on your
board as water canals, you would agree that having a 90 degree corner
will
limit the flow of water that can go through that particular canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This same principle
applies to electricity so
try not to have 90 degree corners in your routing.</p>
