DxDesigner to Expedition PCB: Part 1: Forward Annotation</span></b>
<span style="font-size: 20pt;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This tutorial has been crafted to show you how to perform
forward annotation, also known as &ldquo;what needs to be done in
order to connect your DxDesigner Schematic with Expedition PCB&rdquo;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For this tutorial we provide you
with an example project. This will allow you to see
the steps involved in pushing a small schematic
over to Expedition PCB. The example will be not be close to
the complexity of your project schematic, but often a simple
exercise is enough to demonstrate the methods. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="../FAE/forward_annotation.zip"><u>Click here for
the .zip file</u></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After you download and unzip the
project, <a href="../Import/Import_Project.html">follow these directions</a>
to properly set up the project on your machine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span>Once you have completed the
import tutorial, click on the Design &ldquo;LightCom&rdquo; to view
the following schematic:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 1288px; height: 1002px;" alt="" src="Pictures/1-start.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(1-start.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This small design makes use of eight capacitors,
four LED-diodes, two MAX-232 level-shifter chips, and two 4-pin connectors.
Don't get hung up trying to figure out how this circuit works or
what it does.   It isn't a "real" circuit.  And, it does not do
anything useful. We have created it solely to illustrate the process of
pushing a somewhat simple schematic through to ExpeditionPCB.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The yellow lines are busses, the
purple icons are the parts, and the green lines are nets.
Once you have gone through this tutorial,
please feel free to modify the design so as to get more
familiar with the process of forward annotation. This may help
you debug <b>your</b> design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Since the schematic is already drawn,
all that needs to be
done can be performed by pressing 3 buttons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are shown below</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 95px; height: 26px;" alt="" src="Pictures/2-buttons.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(2-buttons.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The three buttons we are concerned
with are the two on the
left, and then the one on the right.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The first button on the left is the
button for Verify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
pressed, this opens up the following
window</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 711px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="Pictures/3-DRC_window.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(3-DRC_window.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The DRC window has two tabs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Settings tab allows you to specify whether you are
going to check just a single sheet, a block of logic,
a block of logic and all hierarchy underneath it,
or the entire design.  The project we have provided only has
a single sheet, so running the DRC on the entire design is like
running the DRC on the sheet; so use either option for
this tutorial. It is, however, safer to just
select the option to check the entire design.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now, the Rules tab has a lot of
information about specific rules you can check your design
against.  Our recommendation is to enable all rules to check your
design to the fullest. However, it is good idea to consult your
instructor about which rules you need for your design to be
ready for Expedition PCB.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Click the OK button at the bottom of
this window and the DRC will analyze your design.
When it is done analyzing, make sure to check and correct any errors in your
design. If you are following along with the project we
provided, and you have enabled all rules in the DRC, you will find
that there are some errors present in the design.
These errors are because DxDesigner can not tell that the
connectors will drive some lines. These errors also
show up on the lines connected to a capacitor which is driven by the
power plane VCC (which will not drive that line after the capacitor
is fully charged). These errors are true errors, but let us just
ignore them.  In this example, we never intended to drive pins 11 and 10
of both RS232 chips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have familiarized yourself
with the DRC, it is time to check out the Packager,
which is the button immediately to the right of the
Verify button.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 24px; height: 26px;" alt="" src="Pictures/4-packager_button.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(4-packager_button.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once you press the Packager button,
the following window appears.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 428px; height: 518px;" alt="" src="Pictures/5-packager_window.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(5-packager_window.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This window will be creating the PDB
(Parts DataBase) that is used in conjunction with Expedition PCB.
We have only changed one setting in this window and that is the
option in the PDB Extraction Options portion of the window.
Instead of using the option &ldquo;Only Extract Missing Library Data&rdquo;
we have opted to use the option &ldquo;Delete Local Data, then rebuild all
local library data&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The reason to use the last option is
to ensure that all changes you have made to your schematic
are correct and that there are no extra parts contained in
your local parts library. If you ran the packager with the
first option of only extracting missing library data, and
then later found that you had used the wrong part, you would
need to run the packager again.  When you ran it again you
would then be adding the part that you had changed,
but not deleted --- i.e. the wrong part that you
had originally added to the PDB.
We recommend that you play it safe and always rebuild
your local library.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you are ready to run the
packager, click the OK button at the bottom of the window.
This will run a bunch of tests, and will build the PDB.
If there is an error while trying to package, the packager
window will appear again. If this happens then you
will need to check out the packager log file.
This log file can easily be found;  just browse to where you
created your project and then browse
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Integration\PartPkg.log</span>.
If you are following along with the project
we provided, there should be no packaging problems, so your screen
should look like this</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 1288px; height: 1002px;" alt="" src="Pictures/6-packaged.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(6-packaged.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Now you are finally ready to have
DxDesigner give the
schematic information to Expedition PCB.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Click the red button that looks like the following:</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 22px; height: 26px;" alt="" src="Pictures/7-Expedition.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(7-Expedition.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">This will open the following window</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 480px; height: 332px;" alt="" src="Pictures/8-DxD_to_Ex.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(8-DxD_to_Ex.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The only thing that will need to be
changed from the information being presented to you
is the drop down box for "Select Template".
You will be creating a 4-layer board, so click on the template</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 480px; height: 332px;" alt="" src="Pictures/9-DxD_to_Ex_2.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(9-DxD_to_Ex_2.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have selected the 4-layer
template, you are ready to press OK.  Note that this tutorial is
using a "standard" 4-layer template.  When you are designing your
ECE189 project, we will be using a special ECE189 4-layer template
that contains all of ExpeditionPCB configuration settings you
will need.  Now, just be patient as
ExpeditionPCB is loaded and all the information from DxDesigner is
communicated to ExpeditionPCB.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">When the two programs are all done
talking (for now),
Expedition PCB will have loaded and the following window will be
displayed:</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 280px; height: 151px;" alt="" src="Pictures/10-forward_annotate.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(10-forward_annotate.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Click the Button for Yes. You will
have to be patient again
as more information is processed and Expedition PCB will look like the
following when you are required for more input.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 1440px; height: 870px;" alt="" src="Pictures/11-project_integration.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">(11-project_integration.jpg)</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Now the last thing to do before you
are ready to use
Expedition is to click on the first &ldquo;yellow light&rdquo;
in the project integration
button.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will
run the final checks
and all of your project will be loaded into Expedition PCB.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">All of the lights will be green in
the project integration
window when you are finished with DxDesigner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As long as there are no changes that will need to be made
to the connectivity
of the project, Expedition PCB will be the only program you will need
to work
with from now on.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Congratulations!</p>
