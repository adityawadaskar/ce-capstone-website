<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 20pt;"></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 20pt;">Place Menu</span></b><span style="font-size: 20pt;">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Place menu looks like the
following.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 206px; height: 558px;" alt="" src="Pictures/1-place_menu.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(1-place_menu.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The only option from that menu you
will truly need is the
&ldquo;Place Parts and <u>C</u>ells&hellip;&rdquo;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
will open the wizard to place parts/cells on your board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you have performed a
forward annotation,
(the process to obtain cells and how they are connected from a
DxDesigner
schematic) then opening up this window will get you started in the
final
drawing of your board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
place Cells
wizard looks like the following.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 289px; height: 493px;" alt="" src="Pictures/2-place_window.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(2-place_window.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you first open this window it is
a little
deceiving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why,
since we have performed
a forward annotation, are there no parts to be placed?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is because the Expedition PCB interface
recognizes three different statuses for your parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These three statuses are: Placed, Unplaced,
and Distributed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the top of the place window, there
are three check boxes
for each status that a part/cell might be under.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there are no check boxes marked, then
there are no cells/parts to be placed/moved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Click on the check box &ldquo;Unplaced&rdquo; to
populate the field below the check
boxes with all of the unplaced parts/cells.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If you were to click on the &ldquo;Placed&rdquo;
checkbox you will be able to
populate the field below with parts that have already been placed as
well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To the left of the field that gets
populated with all the
parts/cells depending on which check boxes are activated, you will
notice these
4 buttons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 43px; height: 49px;" alt="" src="Pictures/3-buttons.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(3-buttons.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The top two buttons are used to add
parts/cells to the
placement queue, which just so happens to be the field in the center of
the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The button
with two arrows
pointing down will add all parts/cells from the field immediately to
the right
of the buttons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
button with one
arrow pointing down only adds one part/cell as a way to selectively add
parts/cells to the placement queue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once you are parts in your placement
queue you can click on
the apply button at the bottom of the window to start placing those
parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action
will minimize the place window
and you will have a part &ldquo;attached&rdquo; to the mouse
cursor ready for a left click
to place.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The bottom section of the place
window has a display window
on the left and 4 drop down boxes on the right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The drop down boxes are used to determine which action you
will be
performing, the orientation of each part/cell to be placed/picked up
and
whether to place or pick up parts/cells.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The standard settings are to place the parts/cells in
their standard
position and on the top layer of the board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You will only need to change the settings in the 4 drop
down boxes if
you are not going to place parts/cells and/or you want to place them in
a
specific orientation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">While
placing parts on your board, you are not restricted to only placing
parts on
the top layer. &nbsp;There are several methods to place parts on
the bottom
layer of the board. &nbsp;One method is to change the active layer
from &ldquo;top
and bottom&rdquo; to only &ldquo;bottom&rdquo;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doing this
could create some problems later on with accessing parts on the top
layer so I
will show you a better way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">(4-placement.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The
previous picture displays several parts already placed, however there
is one
part that I want to place on the bottom layer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to do that I will need to consult the toolbar
near the bottom
of the screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
toolbar updates with
functions relevant to your current action, and for placement it gives
us the
following options</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">(5-toolbar.jpg)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The
fifth toolbar option is called &ldquo;push&rdquo;. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This button allows you to
place chips on
either to top or the bottom layers.</p>
