<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Central Library</b>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The
central library is a database of multiple linked libraries. Included
among these libraries are the Cells library, Symbols library,
and PadStack library. The central library maintains the link between cells and symbols
which comprises the Parts library.
By having all the libraries maintained as one
entity (the central library) the user is allowed to modify cells
and/or symbols and not worry about having to update every part
that refers to a modified cell or symbol.  The central
library takes care of updating all Parts to reflect the changes made to the Cell or
Symbol.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although multiple central libraries can be created, it is only possible to link
a single central library to a project. If you find yourself needing to add
components to a central library that is write protected, simply create a new
central library and import all components from the write-protected one.
This will give you access to all components from the first
central library as well as the ability to create new components or modify
existing ones. In fact, early in your project development you will want to
make your own central library by starting with the given
<a href="Files/Secure/ECE189Library.zip"><U>ECE189 Central Library</U></a>
(essentially a clean slate but with built-in properly-established design
rules and PCB template) and then importing padstacks, cells, symbols,
and parts from other available libraries to the one that is local and
writeable for your project.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Components</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This term is not defined or used uniquely within the Mentor Graphics tools
but rather is a term used frequently in this document to refer to an instance
of an object from a library.  For instance, a component could be a part from the Parts
library or could be a cell from the Cells library.
The term is used rather than directly saying "part" or "cell" so that all
libraries can be referenced to the action.  If
a particular action is limited to only a particular library or a small
set of libraries then the list of libraries will be given in parentheses.

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Partition</b>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A partition is a user-defined grouping of Parts, Cells, or
Symbols (within
a library). These are essential to organizing your libraries. Think of
partitions as
folders you would create on a computer. You can create as many folders
as you would
like to organize your files but creating too many folders can be
confusing. Partitions are more limited than folders; e.g. partitions
cannot be created within
partitions, though you can create as many partitions in a library
as you like. Partitions also offer a limited amount of
security to your library files in that only one user is allowed to
modify parts in a partition. Once a user begins
editing a part/cell/symbol in a partition, all others who try and
access that partition will only be granted read access.
Once the first user finishes editing the part/cell/symbol, then others
will be able to modify a part/cell/symbol in that partition.
It is recommended that if you plan on having
two users working on parts using the same library that two different
partitions are created so that each user will be able to modify a list
of
parts/cells/symbols without having to wait for the other to finish
before starting work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Local Library</b>:
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This topic is not covered very well in the existing
documentation but is crucial to understand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The local library is used only when the Library Manager is
accessed THROUGH Expedition PCB or DxDesigner. When a
component, be it a Part/Cell/Symbol,
is modified through this path, the component is not saved directly to the
central library, but instead is saved to the local library.
Having modifications of parts/cells/symbols in your local library that
are not imported to the central library eventually
will lead to verification errors. This happens
because the design will be compared to the central library upon
verification, and the part/cell/symbol will be different from the
version found on the central library, thus Expedition/DxDesigner will
detect an error and stop. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">HOW TO AVOID VERIFICATION PROBLEMS:
It is highly recommended that when a part/cell/symbol needs modification, the library manager is
invoked from OUTSIDE the DxDesigner/Expedition PCB programs. This will always
result in modification of the central library rather than the local library.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">WHY HAVE THE LOCAL LIBRARY?:
Expedition PCB maintains a local library as a safety feature
to prevent a user from editing the copy in the central library and then
realizing that he/she messed up such that the original copy cannot be
recovered. By using the local library when editing parts through
DxDesigner/Expedition PCB, users can modify components without worry
that they might overwrite the original copy. This provides a possibility of
restoring everything back to the original state.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">HOW TO MERGE THE LOCAL LIBRARY WITH
THE CENTRAL LIBRARY:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By invoking "Library Services"
through the library manager, parts can be imported from the local
library present in your project as well as from other central libraries.
Components present in the
local library that are modifications of components in
the central library will require an overwrite of the older versions in
the central library. If a user would wish to keep the older version
then they would need to rename either of the parts to
prevent the old version from being overwritten.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Parts</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A "part" is a mapping between
a "symbol" (which represents the connectivity within a schematic) and a
"cell" (which is the device footprint on a printed circuit board). The
mapping relates physical pins of the footprint with logical net names
on the symbol so that the tools know how to maintain and check connectivity
and usage of the part within the design. The "Parts Library" is one
of the libraries present in any central library. It contains an array of
linked Cells and Symbols. The Cells and Symbols are
linked in this fashion so that a schematic may be designed using
Symbols (where the exact footprint dimensions of the chips are not a factor)
while retaining the capability to have all the connections in the schematic
be placed on the board using Cells (where the exact dimensions of the chips
are a factor). Though schematics can use symbols directly (rather than parts) it
is highly advised to design your schematics with parts from the beginning so that
they will not have to later be replaced in order to use the board routing software.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Cells</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A "cell" represents the physical
appearance of a device on a printed circuit board. The "Cell Library" is one
of the libraries present in the central library. Each cell in this library
specifies the details of the footprint of a device.
What this means is that the cell has the exact dimensions of the chip package
it is named after, including the geometrical patterns that must be
present on each of the layers of the PCB. The cell provides the appearance
that allows a chip package to be connected to the board (surface mount,
through-hole, etc).  In practice, "cells" are linked with a symbol in order to form a
"part", and it is the "part" that is referenced in schematics and board-level
manipulations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Symbols</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A "symbol" is a formal
representation of a component that specifies its input, output,
power/ground, and other port attachments. The "Symbol Library" is one of the
libraries present in the central library. Each symbol in this library is a
representation of a chip that can be used in a schematic.
Symbols do not contain the physical ("cell"-level) details necessary
for placing the chip on a printed circuit board; in fact,
a symbol need not even look like the chip it represents.
The primary purpose of "symbols" are for specifying
the connections within a project.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Padstacks</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A "padstack" is a collection of geometric shapes appearing
on each of mask layers surrounding a through-hole in a printed circuit
board. There are also padstack-related geometries associated with surface-mounted
devices.  The "Padstack Library" is one of the libraries present in the central
library.  Each padstack in this library is a representation of a pad or
through-hole to be used in a design. Padstacks are referenced in making Cells;
they are very detailed. They contain exact dimensions that must
precisely correspond to the description of the manufacturer's package.
Our central library has most of the padstacks that we will need already
defined, so once you import all of the padstacks to your project's
central library, there should be no need to edit them or to create more.
If you have the need to create more, access the padstack tutorial for
further information.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Models</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is one of the libraries present in the central library. Currently the library
is unpopulated. However, there is room to place spice or verilog versions
of chips for device emulation. Not needed for this course.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gerber format</b>:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A Gerber file is a standard file format used by printed circuit board fabricators. It
contains all data necessary for computer-controlled machines to create
the exact mask patterns needed for PCB fab. Gerber files typically specify features such as land
patterns, signal traces, and drilled holes, as well as milling and cutting information.
The Gerber format in use today is also known as EIA RS-274-X.
